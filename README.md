# Recipes (recipe-list)

This is a recipe app built using Vue.js and Quasar. The app allows the user to view, add, edit, and delete recipes. However, the new data input by the user does not persist after refreshing. Please also note that currently, the image in each recipe card component only accepts URL links. In future iterations, the app can be improved by allowing users to upload photos of recipes.
